This is my final semester project.

In this project I have selected Personal indicators of heart disease where I have used Regression analysis to conclude my result.

Initially I have done EDA exploratory data analysis. Next I did the pre-processing and converted data set into numeric format. Then I have split the data into train and test datasets and fit them into regression models to find the RMSE values.

Here, I have used three different kinds of regression analysis namely,
1. Lasso Regression
2. Ridge Regression
3. Elastic net Regression

I have calculated RMSE value and compared which gives best RMSE value for our calculation.
