This is my final semester project
In this project I have selected Personal indicators of heart disease where I have used Regression analysis to conclude my result.

Here, I have used three different kinds of regression analysis namely,
1. Lasso Regression
2. Ridge Regression
3. Step wise Regression

I have calculated RMSE value and Adjusted R2 value.
